vimsh and vimsh.bat are simple Vim script shell command line interpreters
for  UNIX and MSDOS respectively.  You type Vim script code into a .vimsh
file  then, using the appropriate interpreter, execute the file from  the
command line.   The interpreter takes this code and encapsulates it  into
a  Vim  script function and calls the function, capturing any output  and
echo-ing it to the shell command line.
